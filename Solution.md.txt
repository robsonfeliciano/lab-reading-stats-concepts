Challenge 1: What is the difference between expected value and mean?1. The mean value is a statistical generalization of multiple occurrences of an event (such as the mean time you waited at the checkout the last 10 times you went shopping, or indeed the mean time you will wait at the checkout the next 10 times you go shopping).2. The expected value refers to a single event that will happen in the future (such as the amount of time you expect to wait at the checkout the next time you go shopping - there is a 50% chance it will be longer or shorter than this). The expected value is numerically the same as the average value, but it is a prediction for a specific future occurrence rather than a generalization across multiple occurrences.Challenge 2: What is the "problem" in science with p-values?The p value is a conditional probability, conditioned on the null hypothesis always being true. Unfortunately, we often replace due to with given, without realizing that this makes it the probability of a completely different event.Challenge 3: Applying testing to a specific case: A/B testing.Display to different merchandising for group A and B.A: With the specific date of end.B: Without the specific date of end.After this, you would compare between the groups the amount of customer that finished the purchase and how much they purchase.Also, I would compare with the average customer before the sales, to check if we had a real impact in the sales due to the offer.
